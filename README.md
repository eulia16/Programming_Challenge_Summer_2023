# Programming_Challenge_Summer_2023
Programming Challenge for Summer 2023

Problem Statement:

The goal of this challenge is to write a C program that can interrogate a connected USB device and collect information about it. The program should print its results to the console, and it should compile and run on a Linux system. Here are some additional optional design considerations:
Possible command line options:
List available devices
Select a specific device
Select specific device attributes
Choose any libraries that you think would be useful

Place the code in a GitHub repository and invite me (JamesPEarly on GitHub or james.early@oswego.edu) as a collaborator.

# Programming_Challenge_Summer_2023
Programming Challenge for Summer 2023

Problem Statement:

The goal of this challenge is to write a C program that can interrogate a connected USB device and collect information about it. The program should print its results to the console, and it should compile and run on a Linux system. Here are some additional optional design considerations:
Possible command line options:
List available devices
Select a specific device
Select specific device attributes
Choose any libraries that you think would be useful

Place the code in a GitHub repository and invite me (JamesPEarly on GitHub or james.early@oswego.edu) as a collaborator.

User Guide:

This script is meant to run on Linux systems, this script specifically was tested on Ubuntu

To use this script, you must first compile the .c file into an executable file, this is performed by 
running the following command in the command line:
cc USBInterrogation.c -o USBInterrogation

this will then create an executable and to run the script, in the command line,
run the following command:
./USBInterrogation

after this the user will be displayed a menu of functionality and then can use the application as desired
